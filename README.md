## ðŸ“Š Excel Analysis Dashboards: Sales & Road Safety
This document provides an overview of two distinct data analysis projects created in Microsoft Excel: an in-depth sales analysis for the Adventure Works company and a detailed dashboard for analyzing road accident statistics.

## Project 1: Adventure Works Sales Analysis

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Adventure Works sales data. The goal is to uncover key performance metrics related to revenue, profit, and transaction volume. The findings are presented in a powerful, interactive dashboard designed for business intelligence and strategic planning.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset
The analysis is built upon a relational dataset from Adventure Works, which includes the following tables:

 * FactInternetSales: Contains the core transaction data.

 * DimProduct: Detailed information about each product.

 * DimCustomer: Information about the customers.

 * DimDate: Time-based data for trend analysis.

 * DimSalesTerritory: Geographical data for sales regions.

 * DimGeography: Further geographical details.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

 ->Total Quantity: 80,087

 ->Total COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): $12.17M

 ->Total Revenue: $20.94M

 ->Total Profit: $8.78M

 ->Profit Margin: 41.91%

 ->Total Transactions: 7.62K

## Visualizations

 * Time Analysis: A detailed look at performance over time, including monthly and yearly trends.

 * Profit by Month & Weekday: Charts showing which months and days of the week are most profitable.

 * Quarterly Profit View: A breakdown of profit performance by quarter.

 * Profit by Country: A comparison of profit generated from different countries.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
 -> Strong Profitability: The company maintains a healthy profit margin of nearly 42%.

 -> Seasonal Trends: The dashboard reveals specific months (e.g., February, May, April) that collectively contribute over a third of the total profit, suggesting seasonal peaks.

 -> Weekday Performance: A significant majority (70.7%) of the total profit is generated during weekdays, indicating that business-to-business or weekday consumer purchasing is a primary driver.

 -> Geographic Strength: Canada stands out as the top-performing country in terms of profit generation.

## Project 2: Road Accident Dashboard

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing road accident data. The objective is to identify patterns and contributing factors in accidents to inform safety initiatives. The dashboard breaks down casualties by severity, vehicle type, road conditions, and time.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset
The analysis is based on a road accident dataset. While the specific tables are not listed, the data contains key attributes such as:

 * Casualty Severity: (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

 * Vehicle Type: (Car, Bus, Bicycle, etc.)

 * Road Conditions: (Road Type, Road Surface)

 * Time & Date: For trend analysis (Monthly, Day/Night).

 * Location: (Urban, Rural)

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

 ->Total Casualties: 417,883

 ->Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)

 ->Serious Casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)

 ->Slight Casualties: 351,436 (84.1%)

## Visualizations
 * Casualties by Vehicle Type: A breakdown of accidents involving different types of vehicles.

 * CY vs PY Monthly Trend: A line chart comparing current year casualty trends against the previous year.

 * Analysis by Road Conditions: Charts showing casualties by road type (e.g., Single Carriageway) and road surface (e.g., Dry, Wet).

 * Location & Time Analysis: Donut charts breaking down casualties by location (Urban vs. Rural) and time (Daylight vs. Dark).

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
 ->Severity Distribution: The vast majority of casualties are slight (84.1%), but fatal and serious incidents still represent a significant number of accidents requiring targeted prevention.

 ->Vehicle Type Dominance: Cars are involved in the overwhelming majority of accidents (79.8% of casualties).

 ->Environmental Factors: Single carriageways are the most common location for accidents, and dry road surfaces see more incidents, suggesting that driver behavior may be a more significant factor than road conditions in many cases.

 ->Location Disparity: Urban areas account for a higher number of casualties (61%) compared to rural areas (39%).
